                <p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif">After
                    convincing my parents to buy me a QBasic programming book in third grade, I was off to the
                    races. Initially, I was self-taught, until I was afforded the luxury of attending the best high
                    school in Georgia in 10th grade to then graduate from. Upon my enrollment, they also began
                    offering a Computer Science course for the first time ever. Dr Vesey was influential to me beyond
                    what
                    she even knows to this day, and she helped me learn Pascal, C++, and Java back in 1997.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif">Fast-forward
                    to my time at the University of Georgia, where Dr. Basnayake inspired me to learn
                    advanced systems and mainframe development, but the curriculum didn't match what I wanted to do
                    in my free time -- build websites. I shifted gears to a hybridized Mathematics degree program
                    where I was able to combine my interest in systems design with mathematical and even biological
                    topics.
                    Dr Zabcic offered a Mathematical Biology course which was arguably the most interesting class I
                    ever took.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif">After
                    school and some freelance web development work, by accident, I fell into recruiting and
                    got to learn from amazing, successful professionals in and outside Atlanta such as Jared Kennedy,
                    Mike
                    Ventura, Joe Ventura, Josh Nazarian, Kelly Meadows, Joel Leege, Kevin Krull, Rebecca Nickeas,
                    and Dave MacKeen. These 6 years of my life were a dream, honestly, as I was doing things I never
                    thought I would be able to, all while helping change peoples lives in the process.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif">For
                    me, my heart has always been in technology. It's no surprise that I find myself devoting all
                    my free time to anything related to technology, computers, gaming, vehicle technology,
                    programming, and things like that. I am going to continue where I left off and become a successful
                    software
                    engineer.</p>
