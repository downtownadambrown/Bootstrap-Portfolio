                <p>After convincing my parents to buy me a QBasic programming book in third grade, I was off to the
                    races. Initially, I was self-taught, until I was afforded the luxury of attending the best high
                    school in Georgia in 10th grade to then graduate from. Upon my enrollment, they also began
                    offering a Computer Science course for the first time ever. Dr Vesey was influential to me
                    beyond what she even knows to this day, and she helped me learn Pascal, C++, and Java back in 1997.</p>
                <p>Fast-forward to my time at the University of Georgia, where Dr. Basnayake inspired me to learn
                    advanced systems and mainframe development, but the curriculum didn't match what I wanted to do
                    in my free time -- build websites. I shifted gears to a hybridized Mathematics degree program
                    where I was able to combine my interest in systems design with mathematical and even biological
                    topics. Dr Zabcic offered a Mathematical Biology course which was arguably the most interesting
                    class I
                    ever took.</p>
                <p>After school and some freelance web development work, by accident, I fell into recruiting and
                    got to learn from amazing, successful professionals in and outside Atlanta such as Jared
                    Kennedy, Mike Ventura, Joe Ventura, Josh Nazarian, Kelly Meadows, Joel Leege, Kevin Krull, and
                    Rebecca Nickeas.
                    These 6 years of my life were a dream, honestly, as I was doing things I never thought I would be
                    able to,
                    all while helping change peoples lives in the process.</p>
                <p>For me, my heart has always been in technology. It's no surprise that I find myself devoting all
                    my free time to anything related to computers, gaming, vehicles, programming, and things like that.
                    I am going to continue where I left off and be a successful software engineer.</p>
